        <p id="pull-request">
            <span>Git</span> is a version control software used for tracking changes in a file. It is used by programmers in 
            the software development phase where all programmers work on a single project and by using Git it helps to know who 
            contributed what in the project.
            <br><br>
            A <span>Pull Request (PR)</span> is a way to submit a contribution to yours or someone else's github repository. 
            A PR tells you what changes you have pushed to a branch in the repository on Github. Once a pull request is opened 
            you can discuss or review the changes before its merged into the main branch.
